# Liferay Animation

This project has been created to showcase embedding css animation framework in liferay using simple fragments.
The project contains a fragment collection which has 3 main fragments:
- **Animation Resources**: You will need to use this fragment at the top of your master page or the page you would like to introduce animation in it; this fragment adds the required **JS** and **CSS** references.
- **Animation Page End Script**: You will need to use this fragment at the bottom of your master page or the page you would like to introduce animation in it; this fragment contains a JavaScript to refresh the animation after page load to insure that the animation is working fine.
- **Animation Container**: You will need to use this fragment as a container of liferay element (widget/fragment) which you would like to apply the animation on it.

###Note! 
_Please note that the required **JS** and **CSS** has been added to the collection resources_
